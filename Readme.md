## Getting started

* execute `gradlew openProjectInMps` (Windows), `sh ./gradlew openProjectInMps` (MacOS)
  * this downloads MPS for your current OS and creates an executable installation in `build/mps-bundle`
  * Windows: executes `build/mps-bundle/mps/bin/mps.bat`
  * MacOS: executes `build/mps-bundle/Contents/MacOS/mps`
